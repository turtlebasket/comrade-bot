⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE
---

Discord has made breaking API changes that make this bot no longer able to read user commands, instead requiring that bots use slash commands. The Discord API wrapper used by Comrade Bot (discord.py) does not appear to have support for slash commands, meaning that Comrade is currently unusable. 

About/Design Philosophy
---

Meet Comrade, a Discord bot who hands decision-making power back to the users themselves. Instead of relying exclusively on a few moderators or an administrator to keep your server running, these choices now available to the people as well. Want a custom emoji? Does someone's toxicity warrant a temporary mute or kick? Take a vote!

Comrade also offers access to a couple of fun image commands, providing easy access to shibe or birb photos.

Basic Commands
---
- `>>help` - Get more detailed command instructions and bot info.
- `>>mute` - Hold a vote to mute a member for 10 minutes.
- `>>kick` - Hold a vote to kick a member.
- `>>ban` - Hold a vote to ban a member.
- `>>addEmote` - Hold a vote to add a proposed server emote (attached to your message as an image).
- `>>shibe`, `>>birb`, `>>cat` - Post an image of the given entity in the current channel.
- `>>ping` - Test bot's server latency
